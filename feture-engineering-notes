1. focus on feature engineering and data preparation as the biggest task in ds process
2. focus on identifying the signal and minimise noise
3. simplify process and tools when possible. Einstein- "everything must be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."


"To build models with ease, use decison trees"

Take unsupervised clusters as feature in supervised model.

Consider each feature as model on its own

Leakage- previous campaigns.

Target mean encoding

Identify stakeholders, work with them from the beginning.
Don't try to sell a product- develop it when already sold.

Undersampling the majority class

Create a model to redict missing values

Replace blood pressure with 0

rule induction
